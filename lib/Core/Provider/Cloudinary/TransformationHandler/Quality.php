/**
 * Class Quality
 * Set compression level to apply to an image as a value between 1
 * (smallest file size possible) and 100 (best visual quality).
 * The quality transformation parameter can be set to auto in order to
 * perform automatic quality selection and image encoding adjustments.
 * Further control of the automatic quality selection is supported as follows:
 *      q_auto - The optimal balance between file size and visual quality.
 *               By default, this is the same as q_auto:good.
 *      q_auto:best - Less aggressive algorithm. Generates bigger files with potentially
 *                    better visual quality. Example of a target audience: photography sites
 *                    that display images with a high visual quality.
 *      q_auto:good - Ensuring a relatively small file size with good visual quality.
 *      q_auto:eco - More aggressive algorithm, which results in smaller files of slightly
 *                   lower visual quality. Example of a target audience: popular sites and
 *                   social networks with a huge amount of traffic.
 *      q_auto:low - Most aggressive algorithm, which results in the smallest files of low visual
 *                  quality. Example of a target audience: sites using thumbnail images that
 *                  link to higher quality images.
