 * Class NamedTransformation.
 *
 * A named transformation is a set of image transformations that has been given a custom name
 * for easy reference. It is useful to define a named transformation when you have a set of
 * relatively complex transformations that you use often and that you want to easily reference,
 * and using named transformations simplifies the enabling/disabling of transformations in
 * Strict Transformations mode.
 * Named transformations can also include other named transformations, which allows you to
 * define a chain of transformations to run on uploaded images very easily.
